# selcto-o-ride

-- Select-o-ride is an application that allows users to choose from different photos
which best describe their driving experience. I.E who you normally drive with, what the terrain is like where you drive, and where you usually park your vehicle. This data is then used to determine which type of vehicle best suits you

-- In order to open and run this project you must fork and clone the repo into your local device. Once forked and cloned you must run the following commands

-- $ npm install -g json-server

-- $ json-server --watch db.json

-- Once you have this done you should be able to open a second terminal in your code editor and run the command $ open index.html

-- This project is created by Freddy Perez and is a simple, fun example of an online quiz used to determine which type of vehicle best suits users. These examples are only suggestions and making decisions on purchasing vehicles based on the feedback from this app is not recommended. (Yet)
